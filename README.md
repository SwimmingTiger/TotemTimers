# TotemTimers_Classic

To update, you can either download all files, rename the folder to TotemTimers and copy to the addon folder (World of Warcraft\_classic_\Interface\AddOns).

If you just want the modified files, you can copy them over your current addon:

  SetupTimers.lua
  
  TotemData.lua
  
  TotemTimers.toc (if you want to get rid of the outdated addon message)
  
  
I am not the author of this addon, just modified it to get it to work after the patch was released.  I will take this down if the original author asks me to.
